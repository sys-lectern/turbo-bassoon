Profile: Initially an aspiring psychology researcher, I became gradually more disillusioned with the state of the field, as well as the quality of my college education. Being unable to legally work in the US as a young adult, when I finally received my greencard I jumped straight into retail and restaurants, where I excelled and quickly rose to management roles. Although I put forth a lot of effort into developing my managerial and team communication skills, I realized the skill and wage ceiling was not much higher than what I had already achieved.<br/><br/>I decided to enter the world of web development and programming to complement my salary, but moreso to put my mind to better use and once again push myself intellectually. Since then I have fallen in love with the many applications of computing, self-teaching on all the languages, frameworks, and technologies mentioned below; I learned and put these skills to use by working with small business after small business because of the immediate impact on the lives of the business-owners and because of the flexibility to learn beyond the limits of web development.<br/><br/>In the near future, my goals are to further expanding into the world of distributed systems/cloud computing as well as helping to define the next generation of user interfaces on a technical level, using the power of localized neural nets, strong encryption, and speedy batch operations powered at a low level by io_uring and SIMD acceleration. The end goal is to bring these tools to the webbrowser to create secure services and apps that truly feel native.
